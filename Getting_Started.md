## Getting started with Speeduino
The Speeduino hardware and software can be setup in many ways and so it can initially be daunting to understand requirements and configuration steps. 

Generally it is best to understand the [hardware requirements](/Hardware_requirements) first and ensure that your sensors are producing signals that speeduino can understand and control. Then decide the board version that works best with the target installation [(v0.3)](/boards/V03) or [(v0.4)](/boards/V04) or a PNP variant.  

The links below will help give an overview of each area, how it should be configured and how it relates to the overall setup.

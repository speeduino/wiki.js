# Temperature based timing changes
Changes in Inlet Air Temperature (IAT), in particular significant increases whilst under boost, can require ignition timing to be pulled. The IAT retard settings allow for this timing adjustment

## Example
Exact settings will be engine dependant, but pulling of ignition timing beyond 100\*C is a common scenario.

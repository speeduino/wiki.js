# Knock Based timing
By utilising the output from an external knock controller, Speeduino has the ability to alter timing when knock is detected. 

> Note: The knock signal into a Speeduino board must come from an external knock amplifier (Eg Plex, TunerNerd etc). This cannot come directly from a knock sensor.

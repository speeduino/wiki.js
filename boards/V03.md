Overview
--------

The v0.3 board was the first widely available Speeduino shield and is suitable for many typical 1-4 cylinder injection and ignition applications (Excluding direct injected engines). It uses screw terminals for all connections in order to make test wiring simple and quick for prototyping. 

Board Features
--------------

The v0.3 boards includes the following features:

-   4 injector channels
-   4 Ignition outputs
-   Fully protected input channels for CLT, IAT, TPS and O2
-   Optional VR conditioner mount on crank and cam inputs
-   MAP sensor mount location
-   4 medium current spare outputs (Eg Fuel pump, thermo fan etc)
-   All I/O through screw terminals on the board
-   Proto area with IO, SPI and power breakouts.

## Physical Layout

## Proto area

The proto area can be used for adding your own circuits on to Speeduino if required or simply as a convenient access point to various connections. The connections broken out to the proto board are:

-   5v and 12v
-   Grounds
-   SPI pins (MOSI, MISO, SCK and SS). Alternatively these can be used as generic digital IO (Arduino pins 50-53)
-   I2C pins (SDA and SCL).
-   3 generic analog inputs (13-15)

## Board Assembly

Refer to the [Board revisions](Board_revisions "wikilink") for a link to the Bill of Materials (BOM) of your specific board.

Assembly of a complete board is relatively straightforward with all components being through hole and labelled on the board (See above mentioned BoM for parts list). Whilst it does not matter which order components are installed, the following is recommended for simplicity:

1. All resistors
2. All diodes (Including LEDS)
3. All capacitors
   * Take note that C14 and C16 are polarised capacitors, meaning that they must be put in the correct way around. The capacitors should be marked with a + sign on one side. On the PCB, the positive side is indicated by a line on the capacitor symbol.
   * ![capacitor_orientation.png](/img/hardware/capacitor_orientation.png){.align-center}

  Correct capacitor orientation
4. All jumper headers (JP\*)
5. Arduino pins:
  * Suggested method: Break header pins into required lengths and insert into an Arduino Mega. Place the board over the top of the pins and solder in place
   * Note that not all the pins on the end double row need to be populated (Though there's no harm in doing so). The odd numbered pins (Eg D23, D25 .. DD53) do not need pins on them.
6. IC sockets
7. MAP sensor (If used)
   * **NOTE:** ALL self assembly boards have the MAP sensor with the hole at the top.
8. All screw terminals
9. All MOSFETs
10. Power regulator

Board Configuration
-------------------

The board can be configured in multiple ways depending on the hardware you use and way your setup is configured.

### Board default outputs

Multiple functions within Speeduino have adjustable outputs or can be set to Board Default. The following are the Default pin outs for the v0.3

**Note:** *These defaults are applicable to the Jan 2017 firmware and newer*

| Function                    | Board output             | Arduino pin |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| Boost control               | S2 Screw terminal        | 7           |
| VVT                         | S1 Screw terminal        | 6           |
| Idle 1                      | Idle Screw terminal      | 5           |
| Idle 2 (3 wire idle valves) | Proto area (Labelled 53) | 53          |
| Fuel pump                   | FP Screw terminal        | 4           |
| Launch/Clutch               | Proto area (Labelled 51) | 51          |

### Optional Components

If using a VR crank sensor, the board will require the addition of a VR conditioner. The board has been designed to work with the dual VR conditioner from JBPerf (http://www.jbperf.com/dual_VR/index.html) which will plug directly in. Other VR conditioners will also likely work, but have not been tested. There is now also an official VR board that can be used, see link on the left.

#### SP721 Over-voltage Protection

For users having difficulty obtaining the SP721 used in some versions, see info on the [SP721 Diode Alternate](https://speeduino.com/wiki/index.php/SP721_Diode_Alternate) page.

### Jumper Configuration

Depending on the type of crank and cam sensors you have, there are a number of jumpers that will need to be set. The jumpers that need setting are:

-   JP1 - This sets whether the Ignition outputs are 12v or 5v. Note that even if you set this to 12v you should \*\*NOT\*\* connect these directly to a high current coil. These outputs should only ever go to a logic level coil or an igniter
-   JP2 - Whether or not the RPM1 (Crank) input should be routed via the (Optional) VR conditioner. This should be set to VR when using either a VR sensor or a hall sensor that switches between 0v-12v
-   JP3 - Same as JP2, but for the RPM2 (Cam) input
-   JP4 - 10k pullup resistor for RPM1 input. Should be jumpered ('On') when a sensor is used that switches between ground and floating (Which is most hall effect sensors)
-   JP5 - Same as JP4, but for the RPM2 (Cam) input

To make this simpler, the most common sensor types and their required configurations are below:

| Crank Sensor              | Cam Sensor            | JP2  | JP3  | JP4 | JP5 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|------|------|-----|-----|
| Hall sensor               | -                     | Hall | Off  | On  | Off |
| VR Sensor                 | -                     | VR   | Off  | Off | Off |
| 0v-12v Hall Sensor (Requires VR Conditioner)  | -                     | VR   | Off  | Off | Off |
| Hall sensor               | Floating Hall sensor  | Hall | Hall | On  | On  |
| VR Sensor                 | Floating Hall sensor  | VR   | Hall | Off | On  |

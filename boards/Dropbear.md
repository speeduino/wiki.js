# Dropbear ECU
The Dropbear is an 8 fuel + 8 ignition ECU powered by the high speed Teensy 3.5 board and is designed to be a complete unit out of the box. This is the most complete and fully featured Speeduino ECU and requires no user assembly. 

## Features

- 8x high impedance injector drivers
- 8x 5v/12v coil pre-drivers (For use with igniters/smart coils)
- 6x medium current (2A) outputs
- 7x analog inputs
- 4x digital inputs
- CAN transceiver
- Onboard SD slot for logging (Requires firmware 202202+)
- Onboard VR conditioner
- Swappable internal MAP sensors
- Onboard baro sensor
- Optional stepper motor driver

## Pin out

The Dropbear ECU uses 2x 24 pin Delphi Sicma connectors. The connectors are keyed and will only connect to the matching colour loom plug.

## Board Configuration
The Dropbear board contains 4 switches and 1 DIP switch pair that can be used to change the setup of the ECU. 

### Crank/Cam inputs
The ECU contains a dual onboard conditioner that can can be used with VR sensors. The selection between Hall/Optical sensors and VR sensors is made via a pair of switches, one each for the crank and cam. These can be selected independently for setups that use one of each sensor type. 

When set for Hall sensors, this input will work with both the traditional ground switching sensor (the pullup resistor is on the board and does not need to be added) or a 0-12v signal as used on some GM vehicles. 

#### Crank filter
The board includes a variable hardware filter on the crank input that can be used to adjust the amount of hardware filtering being used on this signal. This is designated `SW4` or `SW3` on the PCB and operates on both Hall and VR inputs. 

> Changing this filter from the default setting (On/On) is not required in most cases. It should only be considered if the trigger is utilising 60+ teeth at crank speed. 
{.is-warning}

The switches come with an insulating Kapton seal on them that must be removed before the switches can be adjusted. If not adjusting filter this tape should be left in place. 

![Dropbear crank filter switch](/img/boards/filter_dip.jpg){.align-center width=150}

Recommended values for the filters are shown below (By default both switches will be in the On position):

| Tooth count (at crank speed)  | Switch 1 | Switch 2 |
|-------------------------------|----------|----------|
| Less than 60                  |    On    |    On    |
| 60-100                        |    On    |    Off   |
| 100+                          |    Off   |    On    |

> Both switches can be set to off, however doing so will disable all hardware filtering. This can be useful when performing bench testing with a stim, but is not recommend for real world use
{.is-warning}


### MAP Selector
The Dropbear board uses a removable MAP card containing the sensor and a short hose running to the bulkhead connector on the enclosure. Currently only the default 0-250kpa sensor board is available, with higher range boards to be made available in the future. To use this MAP card, select the `Int.` (Internal) option on the MAP switch. 

If you wish to use an external MAP sensor located in the engine bay, this switch should be to to `Ext.` and the sensors signal line should be connected to pin `C8` on the Black connector. The MAP card can be left in place or removed when the `Ext.` option is used. 

### CAN terminator
Dropbear units have a built-in CAN transceiver that can be connected directly to the CAN bus in your vehicle as the circuit is unterminated by default. If you wish to do any bench testing or are using an isolated CAN bus, you may wish to have this network terminated and there is a resistor on-board for this. 

To enabled the terminating resistor a solder bridge must be added to the following jumper point

![Dropbear CAN terminator bridge](/img/boards/dropbear_can_terminator.jpg){.align-center width=100}

### Stepper Driver
By default the Dropbear unit is designed for use with PWM idle valves, however an optional stepper motor driver can be fitted. 

> Please note that using the stepper driver requires pins C3 through C6 on the grey connector. Other output functions cannot use these pins when a stepper driver is installed
{.is-warning}

The board has a socket to install a standard DRV8825 stepper motor driver if required. It should be installed in the following orientation if needed:

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

- **Does this board use the same firmware / ini file as other Speeduinos?**
	- The firmware itself is the same, but must be compiled for the Teensy board (if you are compiling yourself). If you are using SpeedyLoader, it will detect the board and load the correct version on automatically (Make sure you are using the latest version v1.5+). The ini file is the same one that is used on other boards
- **Sensor values are not reading correctly**
  - The board must be powered with 12v for the sensors to read correctly. If only connected via USB the sensors readings will not work correctly
- **MAP reading is incorrect (Other sensors are OK)**
  - Check that the Internal/External MAP switch is set correctly on the board. 
- **Which crimping tool should I use with these connectors?**
  - The recommended tool is an **SN-28B** style crimper, which can generally be found fairly inexpensively and is straightforward to use. 
- **I can't connect to the Dropbear unit in TunerStudio**
  - The serial drivers for the Teensy board inside the Dropbear come included with Windows 10/11, MacOS and linux. If you are running an earlier version of Windows (Eg XP, Vista, 7 or 8) then you will need to install the driver from : http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/serial_install.exe

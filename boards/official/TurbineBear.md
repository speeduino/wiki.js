# Turbine Controller
Blah blah

## Features

Blah

## Board Configuration
The Dropbear board contains 4 switches and 1 DIP switch pair that can be used to change the setup of the ECU. 

### RPM 1/2 (N1/2) inputs
The ECU contains is designed to take 2 hall/optical inputs. 

#### N1 filter
The board includes a variable hardware filter on the N1 input that can be used to adjust the amount of capacitor filtering being used on this signal. This is designated `N1 Filter` on the PCB. 

> Changing this filter from the default setting (On/On) is not required in most cases. It should only be considered if the trigger is utilising 60+ teeth at crank speed. 
{.is-warning}

The switches come with an insulating Kapton seal on them that must be removed before the switches can be adjusted. If not adjusting filter this tape should be left in place.

Recommended values for the filters are shown below (By default both switches will be in the On position):

| Tooth count (at crank speed)  | Switch 1 | Switch 2 |
|-------------------------------|----------|----------|
| Less than 60                  |    On    |    On    |
| 60-100                        |    On    |    Off   |
| 100+                          |    Off   |    On    |

> Both switches can be set to off, however doing so will disable all hardware filtering. This can be useful when performing bench testing with a stim, but is not recommend for real world use
{.is-warning}

## EGT inputs
The v0.2 controller contains a total of 4 EGT circuits, however EGT1 and EGT2 could not be fully populated at PCBA time and should not be used. There are override pins on the Black connector for EGT1 and EGT2 inputs however that allow the use of external thermo amps

EGT 3 and 4 on the Grey connector use digital thermo amps on board. 

An option will be added in TunerStudio to select whether EGT 1/2 or EGT 3/4 should be used. 


## Pin out

The ECU uses 2x 24 pin Delphi Sicma connectors. The connectors are keyed and will only connect to the matching colour loom plug.

## Engine States
| State Number | Description | Exit Condition | Next State |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| 0						 | **OFF**. Fuel is turned off, all relay outputs turned off. | RPM is detected or starter button pin goes to ground | 1-5 based on RPM detected. Will be state 1 if starter pin is grounded |
| 1						 | **PRE-START**. Starter is turned on but fuel and ignition are off. Will remain in this mode until RPM reaches defined level or times out | RPM exceeds X1 or time with starter on exceeds timeout value | 2 (or 0 if timed out) |
| 2						 | **START**. Fuel and ignition are turned on  | RPM exceeds X2 or time with starter on exceeds timeout value | 3 (or 0 if timed out) |
| 3            | **PRE-WARMUP**. Fuel is commanded to 'Starter fuel duty'. Starter is off. Ignition is off | 	RPM exceeds X3 | 4 |
| 4            | **WARMUP**. Fuel duty is based on warmup curve | RPM exceeds X4 | 5 |
| 5            | **IDLING**. Fuel duty is based on Idle Duty setting | Run switch pin is pulled to ground | 6 |
| 6            | **RUNNING**. Fuel duty is based on main 3D lookup table | Run switch pin is no longer pulled to ground | 5 |
| 7            | **EGT PROTECTION**. Fuel is commanded to 0 | RPM drops to 0 and remains there for 1 second | 0 |
| 8            | **TEST**. Unused test mode | NA | NA |
| 9            | **KILLED**. Engine has been killed due to kill switching being pressed | Engine RPM returns to 0 | 0 |

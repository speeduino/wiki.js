# High level wiring guide

Speeduino can be configured in many ways depending on the engine, sensors, ignition and fuel hardware being used. For this reason it is impossible to provide 1 single diagram that will cover all scenarios, however the below is provided as a high level guide that can be used as a starting point. 

See the [Hardware Requirements](/Hardware_requirements) page for specific requirments and exceptions to the image below.

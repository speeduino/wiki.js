# Output Hardware Test Page

The output hardware test page offers the ability to test the Speeduino Output stages whilst the engine is NOT running only.

This is useful to check that wiring and actuator/output devices are functioning as intended. <img src="output_testing.jpg" title="fig:output_testing.jpg" alt="output_testing.jpg" width="500" />

By selecting "Enable Test Mode" button the option to activate other tests will become available.

By clicking on "Stop Test Mode" or upon closing the output test page , test mode will be disabled and all outputs returned to their default states.

## Injector Driver Output Test

> **CRITICAL** Use care when testing injectors with this feature. If your fuel system has line pressure or the fuel pump is running you will get fuel flow into the engine which could cause serious starting issues or even hydraulic lock!(a very serious flooding of the engine bore resulting in potentially major engine damage)

Pressing _On_ on the respective channel will activate that individual channels output stage.

Pressing _Off_ will turn that channel back off.

## Ignition Driver Output Test


> **CRITICAL**  Use care when testing spark drivers with this feature. If you touch your HT circuit and it is activated by the spark driver you could receive a potentially lethal electric shock!! Leaving your coils charging for an excessively long period will cause them to overheat and may burn out!

Pressing _On_ on the respective channel will activate that individual channels output driver stage.

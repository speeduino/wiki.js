## GM 24X

### Overview

This a 24 tooth wheel with 12 wide teeth and 12 narrow teeth. The narrow provides 3 degrees of pulse while the wide provides 12. All of the falling edges are 15 degrees apart. This decoder uses the falling edges, requiring the cam signal to determine crank angle.

> The "Dual wheel" decoder set to 24 teeth and `FALLING` edge should be used rather than the dedicated 24X decoder. An updated version of the dedicated 24X decoder remains a WIP.

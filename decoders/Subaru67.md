# Subarau 6/7 Decoder
## Availability
Available in the main firmware release. This decoder had a revision to improve reliability in the 2023.05 firmware release.

## Background
Supports the 6 tooth crank and 7 tooth cam decoder used on early Subaru. Superceeded by the 36-2-2-2 decoder around 2001.

## Limitations
Does not support active valve control system (AVCS, more commonly known as Variable Valve Timing) currently.


## Setup
Under trigger pattern select "Subaru 6/7". Ignore historic values that are now greyed out, eg primary base teeth. If you have VR sensors, select the trigger edge based on your VR decoder (see trigger edge hint in tuner studio for reconmendations). 

Now use a timing light and locked ignition to identify your trigger angle.

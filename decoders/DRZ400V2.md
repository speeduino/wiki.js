# Overview
## Availability
This decoder is available as part of the current release.

## Background
Decoder developed for the DRZ400 motorbike based on the dual wheel decoder. 

The primary trigger has no missing teeth and has many teeth as specified in tuner studio to increase the flexibility of this solution for other bikes.

The secondary decoder is designed to support 1+1 trigger wheels. To maximise flexibility for different bikes the system triggers on the first tooth found and then ignores all subsequent secondary teeth that occur within half a crank revolution.

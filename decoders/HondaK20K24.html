<p>Placeholder page for Honda K20/K24 decoder that is currently in development/test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This supports both the Exhaust 4+1 cam and the inlet 4 tooth cam and VVT for both. VR1 needs to be the exhaust and VR2 needs to be in the inlet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NB the v0.4 board can only process 1 cam signal without modification.</p>

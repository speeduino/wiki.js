<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Decoder developed for the DRZ400 motorbike based on the dual wheel decoder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The primary trigger has no missing teeth and as many teeth as specified in tuner studio to increase the flexibility of this solution for other bikes.</p>
<p>The secondary is 1+1, &nbsp;one large and one small immediately after it. The trigger ignores all teeth that occur within half a crank revolution. This allows the code to only see one tooth on the secondary - allowing the code to sync.</p>
